# About

A Pokémon themed clicker/idle/incremental game that is still in very early development.

Source is built in TypeScript along with vanilla JavaScript.

# Project State

Currently, PokéEggs is not a playable game whatsoever.

The state of PokéEggs is currently in early development.

I plan to solo dev this project for the foreseeable future. Eventually, I may branch out with accepting more direct help with it when it's something more complete. We'll see.
